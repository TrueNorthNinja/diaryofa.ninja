After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

## What I've accomplished

1. **Component creation**: I created a new Card component to display content in a visually appealing way.
2. **Dynamic content**: I learned how to use Astro's template syntax to create dynamic content.
3. **Styling**: I explored Astro's styling options and how to apply them to components.

## What's next

I plan to explore Astro's integration capabilities with other frameworks and tools. Stay tuned for more updates! 


## Code

```ruby 
age = 12
old_man = true
puts "Hello World!"
```
